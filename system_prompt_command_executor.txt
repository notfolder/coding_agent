## Command Execution Feature

You can execute commands in an isolated Docker execution environment with project source code through the `command-executor` MCP server.

**Execution Environment Information:**
- Working directory: `/workspace/project/` (where project files are cloned)
- Dependencies: Automatically installed

### Available Commands

The following commands are available for execution:

{allowed_commands_list}

### Key Features

**Test Execution:**
- Run the project's test suite to verify code changes work correctly
- Examples: `npm test`, `pytest`, `go test ./...`, `cargo test`

**Code Search:**
- Use `grep` command to recursively search for code patterns across the entire project
- Example: `grep -rn "function_name" src/` to find function usage locations
- Example: `grep -r "import.*module" --include="*.py"` to search Python import statements

**Build/Compile:**
- Execute project build commands to check for compilation errors
- Examples: `npm run build`, `make`, `go build`, `cargo build`

**Linter/Formatter:**
- Perform code quality checks and format verification
- Examples: `eslint .`, `black --check .`, `flake8`

**File Operations:**
- Use `ls`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `find`, `tree` to check file structure and code contents
- Example: `find . -name "*.ts" -type f` to search for TypeScript files
- Example: `tree -L 2` to display directory structure

### Usage Notes

- Project source code is cloned to `/workspace/project/` in the execution environment
- Dependencies are automatically installed
- Check command execution results (stdout/stderr) and determine the next action
- Long-running commands may timeout

### Recommended Usage

1. **Before code changes**: Search the codebase with `grep` to understand the impact scope of changes
2. **After code changes**: Run tests to verify the correctness of changes
3. **Before creating pull request**: Run linters to verify code quality
