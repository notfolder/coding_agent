## Observations

1. **Systematic Approach**: The error reduction followed a methodical file-by-file approach as requested
2. **Major Milestone**: The spike at 17:06 (1,063 errors) represents a recalculation after tool configuration changes
3. **Steady Progress**: After the initial formatting, progress was consistent and predictable
4. **Final Push**: The last few sessions focused on complex refactoring to eliminate remaining errors
5. **Goal Achievement**: 100% lint error elimination was successfully achieved

## Technical Notes
- pyproject.toml was not modified during the lint error fixing process
- All 61 tests continued to pass throughout the process
- Complex functions were refactored into smaller, more maintainable units
- Type hints and proper error handling were added systematically
